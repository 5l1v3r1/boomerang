This repository is now connected to continous integration server:
http://boomerang.nemerle.eu

This is an experimental branch of boomerang project, the inital goals are:
- 'clean' up the repository ( removing old .cvsignore files and such ) [done]
- move all old build systems into "out of sight" storage. [done]
- try to fix all warnings from gcc -Wall, and clang -Wall
- verify stability of decompilation results : compare 2 run results, they should be exactly the same.


For build instructions please see

        http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/making.html

Note that on a debian system you can usually get away with:

  sudo apt-get install libgc-dev
  sudo apt-get install libexpat-dev
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Thanks.
