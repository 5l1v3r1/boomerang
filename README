This is an experimental branch of boomerang project, the inital goals are:
- 'clean' up the repository ( removing old .cvsignore files and such )
- move all old build systems into "out of sight" storage.



For build instructions please see 

	http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/making.html

Note that on a debian system you can usually get away with:

  sudo apt-get install libgc-dev
  sudo apt-get install libexpat-dev
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Thanks.
