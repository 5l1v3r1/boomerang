- Fixed: Crash when decompiling recursive functions containing switch statements or computed calls.
- Fixed: Crash when decompiling x86 binaries that contain a JO/JNO instruction.
- Fixed: Potential crash after removing unused global variables.
- Fixed: Disabled direct editing of file selection combobox in boomerang-gui.
- Fixed: A large number of memory leaks.

- Changed: GUI update. Added settings wrt. decoding and decompilation to Settings Dialog.
- Changed: Renamed 'print-*' console command to a single 'print' command with arguments.
- Changed: Added '-i' command line option for interactive (command) mode. Deprecated '-k' switch kept for backwards compatibility.
