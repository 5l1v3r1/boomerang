/**
 * Before Type Analysis, refs like r28{0} have a nullptr Statement pointer.
 * After this, they will point to an implicit assignment for the location.
 * Thus, during and after type analysis, you can find the type of any
 * location by following the reference to the definition
 * Note: you need something recursive to make sure that child subexpressions
 * are processed before parents
 * Example: m[r28{0} - 12]{0} could end up adding an implicit assignment
 * for r28{-} with a null reference, when other pieces of code add r28{0}
