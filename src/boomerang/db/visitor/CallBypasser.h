/**
 * A modifying visitor to process all references in an expression, bypassing calls (and phi statements if they have been
 * replaced by copy assignments), and performing simplification on the direct parent of the expression that is modified.
 * \note this is sometimes not enough! Consider changing (r+x)+K2) where x gets changed to K1. Now you have (r+K1)+K2,
 * but simplifying only the parent doesn't simplify the K1+K2.
 * Used to also propagate, but this became unwieldy with -l propagation limiting
