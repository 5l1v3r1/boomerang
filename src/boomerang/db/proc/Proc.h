     * be passed to this procedure. The modification will be to either add
     * dummy locations to actuals, delete from actuals, or leave it
     * unchanged.
     * Add "dummy" params: this will be required when there are
     *     less live outs at a call site than the number of parameters
     *     expected by the procedure called. This will be a result of
     *     one of two things:
     *     i) a value returned by a preceeding call is used as a
     *        parameter and as such is not detected as defined by the
     *        procedure. E.g.:
     *
     *           foo(bar(x));
     *
     *        Here, the result of bar(x) is used as the first and only
     *        parameter to foo. On some architectures (such as SPARC),
     *        the location used as the first parameter (e.g. %o0) is
     *        also the location in which a value is returned. So, the
     *        call to bar defines this location implicitly as shown in
     *        the following SPARC assembly that may be generated by from
     *        the above code:
     *
     *            mov      x, %o0
     *            call  bar
     *            nop
     *            call  foo
     *
     *       As can be seen, there is no definition of %o0 after the
     *       call to bar and before the call to foo. Adding the integer
     *       return location is therefore a good guess for the dummy
     *       location to add (but may occasionally be wrong).
     *
     *    ii) uninitialised variables are used as parameters to a call
     *
     *    Note that both of these situations can only occur on
     *    architectures such as SPARC that use registers for parameter
     *    passing. Stack parameters must always be pushed so that the
     *    callee doesn't access the caller's non-parameter portion of
     *    stack.
     *
     * This used to be a virtual function, implemented differenty for
     * LibProcs and for UserProcs. But in fact, both need the exact same
     * treatment; the only difference is how the local member "parameters"
     * is set (from common.hs in the case of LibProc objects, or from analysis
     * in the case of UserProcs).
